# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast arrays and hashes in Ruby. Include at least two differences and two similarities.

Your answer:
similarities 
- both hashes and arrays are used to store data
- they both can be iteratted over
differences 
- hashes are wrapped with curly braces while arrays are wrapped in []


Researched answer:
differences 
- hashes are a dictionary like collection of unique key items
while arrays is just a collection of similiar items 
- hashes can use any object type as its index while arrays use integers as its index

similarities
- they both can be iteratted over but hashes you can go to a specific item in the hash while array you can not 



2. What does it mean to implement a TTD workflow?

Your answer: TTD workflow is the process of writing a test describe, it, and expect, then creating code to make the test pass in ruby we use rspec and in Js we use yarn/jest


Researched answer: a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code is implemented. Often referred to as the "Red-Green-Refactor".First, a small unit test is written for the functionality that needs to be implemented.Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass. Once the test is passing, the code can be refactored. Refactoring means improving the code's structure, readability, or efficiency without changing its behavior.

3. Why would super be used in a Ruby class?

Your answer: super in a ruby class is used to get the info from the main class

Researched answer: used to invoke the method in the parent class, it can override the method and use super to call the superclass's implementation within its own implementation.



4. STRETCH: What is the difference between inheritance in JavaScript and inheritance in Ruby?

Researched answer:avaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, where objects can inherit properties and methods directly from other objects. Ruby uses class-based inheritance, where classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. Classes can inherit attributes and behaviors from other classes.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. PostgreSQL:PostgreSQL is a powerful, free, and open-source database system. It's used to store and manage large amounts of data for applications. PostgreSQL is known for its reliability, ability to handle complex tasks, and flexibility.

2. Ruby on Rails:Ruby on Rails, often called Rails, is a web development framework. It provides tools and conventions to make it easier to build web applications. 

3. Active Record:Active Record maps database tables to Ruby classes and database rows to objects, allowing developers to work with databases using Ruby code without writing SQL queries explicitl
